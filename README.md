# [scheme-live](https://github.com/scheme-live/live)

**Scheme library collection with yearly stable releases**

## Prelude

Let's agree that *serif* fonts do not always carry boring stuff. And have a taste of it:

Otherwise said, Scheme offers a minimalist core of powerful primitives
upon which one can build abstractions to solve (real world) problems.

- Be a complement to [SRFI](https://srfi.schemers.org/),
  [R7RS](https://r7rs.org), and work together following the [goals set
  by the steering commitee, and R7RS-large working group
  charter](http://scheme-reports.org/2010/working-group-2-charter.html);

- Release yearly stable versions: next, and **first stable release**
  planned in 2023;

- Aim for portability across Scheme standards, Scheme implementations,
  and operating systems;

- Libraries are collectively owned;

- Resolve debates by talking;

- Libraries inside `unstable` are always subject to change;
