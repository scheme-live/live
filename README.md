  by the steering commitee, and R7RS-large working group
  charter](http://scheme-reports.org/2010/working-group-2-charter.html)

- Release yearly stable versions:next, and first stable release
  planned in 2023;

- Aim for portability across Scheme standards, Scheme implementations,
  and operating systems;

- Libraries are collectively owned;

- Resolve debates by talking;

- Libraries inside `unstable` are always subject to change;
