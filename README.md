- Be a complement to SRFI, RnRS, and work together;

- Make one collection of libraries that work cohesively together;

- Resolve the the debate by talking instead of forking code.

- Prefer interfaces that are portable to different Scheme standards,
  Scheme implementations, and operating systems;

- All libraries are collectively owned. Inside the namespaces
  `unstable`, everything is subject to change;

- Release stable versiones yearly;
