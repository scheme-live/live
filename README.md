# Scheme Live

- Move fast. (Be a complement to SRFI and RnRS which move slower.)

- Make one collection of libraries that work cohesively together.

- Make one complete library for each job instead of several incomplete
  libraries. When we can't agree, resolve the the debate by talking
  instead of forking code.

- Prefer interfaces that are portable to different Scheme standards,
  Scheme implementations, and operating systems. Porting is done by
  whoever has time to do it.

- All libraries are collectively owned. In the unstable version, all
  libraries are subject to change.

- Release a stable version of our collection periodically.

- Work with RnRS, SRFI, and other library authors to share interfaces
  and implementations whenever possible.
